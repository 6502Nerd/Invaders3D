This folder contains C and ASM source for a simple 3D invaders style game

This has been built using the OSDK toolchain

To build, ensure you have OSDK installed and configured

Then type 'osdk_build' to build the project

Once done (normally a couple of seconds), enter 'osdk_execute' to start the Oric emulator and automatically load and run the game.

This game uses the dflat libraries for fast graphics and keyboard handling, plus PT3 player and resources for in-game music.

PT3 music and player is not my own but sourced from internet.
